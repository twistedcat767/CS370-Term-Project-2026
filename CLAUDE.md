# <CS370 Term Project- Green>: team rules
## Commands
- Build: ‘make‘ Cross/deploy: ‘make deploy PI=pi@<host>‘
- Tests: ‘make test‘ Sanitizers: ‘make asan‘ Valgrind: ‘make memcheck‘
- Soak sanity: ‘make soakcheck‘ (1-hour miniature of the 48h run)
- A change is DONE only when build, test, and asan pass. Show output.
## Hard constraints
- The PRODUCT makes no network calls except serving its own LAN
interface. No LLM APIs, no cloud inference, no pretrained models.
The intelligence in analysis/ is ours. This is a graded boundary.
- Every daemon must be supervisable: clean exit codes, no orphaned
fds across restart, heartbeat within 60s of start.
- Every allocation checked; every syscall’s error path handled and
logged. The 48-hour soak is the test suite of last resort.
- NEVER weaken, skip, or delete a test to make the suite pass.
## Ownership
- alice/: capture pipeline, kernel-facing code (src/capture, src/drv)
- bob/: storage layer, analysis engine (src/store, src/analysis)
- Shared: supervisor, interface. The agent edits outside the current
session owner’s area only when told explicitly whose session this is.
## Style
- Systems core: C17, -Wall -Wextra -Werror, no VLAs.
goto-cleanup for multi-resource functions.
- Python permitted only under tools/ and ui/. No graded mechanism
may live there.
- Smallest diff that passes. Do not refactor unrelated code.
## Workflow
- Multi-file or algorithmic change: plan first, wait for approval.
- Hardware bugs: paste real evidence (dmesg, timing capture,
/proc/interrupts). No fixes proposed from a verbal description.
- Commit only from a green state; message format "M<n>: <what>".
